% This is a name changer for tracking results generated by the benchmark
% in case sometimes there are some configuration errors before running. 
%
% Instructions on how to use this tool:
% 1. configure original tracker name and its directory
% 2. configure target tracker name and its directory
% 3. configure whether the original files should be deleted
% 4. configure sequence names by changing settings in file
%    'configSeqs_for_name_changer' 
% 5. Run this script

% Configuration
% original tracker name
original_tracker_name = 'example_original_tracker_name';
original_path = 'D:\example\original\tracker\path\';

% target tracker name
target_tracker_name = 'example_target_tracker_name';
target_path = 'D:\example\target\tracker\path\';

% whether original one should be deleted
delete_original = 1; % 0 - no, 1 - yes

% config the sequence names (you could also easily copy from benchmark
% directly)
seqs = configSeqs_for_name_changer;

%% Running
for ii = 1:length(seqs) 
    % constructing the original and target files
    original_file_name = [seqs{ii}.name, '_', original_tracker_name, '.mat'];
    target_file_name = [seqs{ii}.name, '_', target_tracker_name, '.mat'];
    
    % loading and saving the mats
    load([original_path, original_file_name]);
    save([target_path, target_file_name], 'results');
    
    % deciding whether to delete the original
    if delete_original == 1
        eval(['delete ''', original_path, original_file_name, '''']);
    end
end
